If you render webpages dynamically (using PHP) that are used to display relatively static websites or content, you may want to consider caching the page for a period of time. It’s particularly useful if your static website makes a large number of database queries or integrates external content. Caching will reduce the time it takes for each page to load and minimise the load on your web server.

I cache just about every static website I operate since they make countless requests for information to numerous locations (sometimes I’ll cache a page for as long as a week). I don’t use the code below myself (I use a far more robust solution)… but it is very effective and implemented in about a minute.



# Install Notice!
Step 3 - Add the php code / include("anchorCache/anchorCache.php"); / On all pages your!

<?php include("anchorCache/anchorCache.php"); ?>
If capturing an entire page, you’ll want to cache everything between the opening and closing HTML tags.
